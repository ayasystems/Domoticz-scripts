-- This script can be used to control garden or porch lights: These 
-- lights should go on when it gets dark and off when the sun comes 
-- up. But, if you're anything like me, you think it's a waste to 
-- leave them on whennobody's there to see them anyway. So you want 
-- them to go off while you're asleep. This sounds simple, but your 
-- sleep time may vary, plus the time the sun sets and rises varies 
-- throughout the year. So much even that in some periods the sun does
-- not set before you go to sleep or it is up already before you wake
-- up, in both situations the lights never need to switch on. This 
-- simple script accomplishes this task with ease. Plus it makes it
-- easy to adapt the timers to you personal life style.
-- 
-- How does it work? 1st you create 2 dummy On/Off switches. The names 
-- of these switches you later put in the settings below this comment. 
-- On one of the switches you define 2 timers:
--  1 - On at 30 minutes before sunset
--  2 - Off at 30 minutes after sunrise
-- On the other switch you define 4 timers:
--  1 - On at 23:00 on work days
--  2 - Off at 7:00 on work days
--  3 - On at 0:00 on weekend days
--  4 - Off at 9:00 on weekend days
-- Of course you can vary the timers on the 2nd switch depending on 
-- your personal life style.
-- Now you paste this script code into a DzVents script, fill in the 
-- names of the both dummy switches you created. And you fill in the 
-- names of the lights you want to switch. If you want to switch more 
-- than one light, simply enter multiple names, separate them with a
-- comma. Then give your script a name and click the Save button.
-- To see if it works, you don't need to wait for the evening, you 
-- can simply push the buttons yourself :-). This is also a nice way
-- to override the timers if you're one day expecting someone to 
-- arrive late or early.
-- Instead of using a timer for the darkness switch, you can also opt 
-- to use a lux meter to actually measure darkness and feed this into 
-- the script. I don't have an outdoor lux sensor, so I leave that to 
-- your own imagination.


-- Specify the name of the 1st dummy switch here.
local DARK_TIMER_NAME = 'Timer voor buitenlampen'


-- Specify the names of the switches for your garden or porch lights
-- here. If you want to switch multiple lights specify them like
-- { 'light1', 'light2', 'light3' }
local SWITCHES = { 'Hut: Brandgang lamp' }

return {
	on = {
		devices = {
			DARK_TIMER_NAME
		}
	},
	execute = function(domoticz, device)
	    domoticz.log('Device ' .. device.name .. ' was changed', domoticz.LOG_INFO)
	    
	    if device.isDevice and (DARK_TIMER_NAME == device.name or SLEEP_TIMER_NAME == device.name) then
            local dark = domoticz.devices(DARK_TIMER_NAME)

    	    if nil == dark then
    	        domoticz.log( "Missing device " .. DARK_TIMER_NAME .. ".", domoticz.LOG_ERROR)
    	    else
    	        domoticz.devices().filter(SWITCHES).forEach(
    	            function(light)
            		    if dark.active then
            		        if not light.active then
            		            light.switchOn()
            		        end
                        else
                            if light.active then
                	            light.switchOff()
                	        end
                        end
    	            end
